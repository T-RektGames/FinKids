One advantage of storing your money in a bank, is that increases over time, based on a interest rate offered by a bank. To store money in the bank, you must first create a account with a bank. For your first time, the simplest account to create will be a savers account, which allows you to retrieve money at immediate notice, but will have a small interest rate. To create an account you need to provide a form of personal verification like a IC or Student pass. Some accounts will also require minimum deposit amount to create. \n" +

Simple interest is only based on the amount of money deposited. For example, if you deposit a amount of $50, and the interest is 10% per year, at the end of the year the additional money you gain is $5. Compounded interest, however, also acts on the amount of interest accumulated over time. For example the account has a 10% interest per year, with interest compounded monthly and you deposit $50, Hence at the end of the first month, you will have $50.4. The seconds monthâ€™s interest will be based upon, $50.4 instead of $50. Hence at the end of the year you will gain $5.2.\n" +

How the bank keeps the flow of money going is by lending the money you deposit in the bank to others, in the form of loans. So it is a fact, that if everyone tries to withdraw money at the same time, or if an extremely large group of people are unable to return their loans, the bank might not have enough money for you to withdraw from your own account. That might alarm you, but there are regulations, especially from the government that force banks to have certain amount of cash reserves. At the same time, events where the bank doesn't have enough money are extremely rare, and  if it does happen it is often prevented by the government by injecting the national budget into banks to revive them. This is called a bailout. As such banks are considered a rather safe avenue to save and grow your wealth.\n" +
